Water is essential for life. We need it for drinking, cooking, and sanitation. Agriculture accounts for about 70% of global freshwater use, while industry uses about 20%, and domestic use accounts for the remaining 10%.

Many regions are already experiencing water scarcity. In some parts of Africa and Asia, people have to walk miles to fetch water. In other areas, groundwater is being depleted faster than it can be replenished.

To address this crisis, we need to use water more efficiently. This includes fixing leaky pipes, using drip irrigation in agriculture, and recycling wastewater. We also need to protect our water sources from pollution and invest in new technologies for water desalination and purification.

Question: According to the passage, what percentage of global freshwater is used for agriculture?`,

    stem: `Passage: What happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object is a question that has perplexed many philosophers for thousands of years. Today, this classic paradox makes a good metaphor for one of the world's most important issues.

The "unstoppable force" is the continually increasing worldwide demand for energy. The "immovable object" is the world's rapidly diminishing fossil-fuel reserves and the growing acceptance that burning these fuels is causing climate changes that will have profoundly negative effects on future generations.

Worldwide demand for electrical energy is increasing and all indications are that it will continue to increase for the foreseeable future. Even if we found enormous new reserves of fossil fuels, we would not be able to continue burning them because of their contribution to global warming.

Question: What can we infer from the classic paradox mentioned in Paragraph 1?`,
